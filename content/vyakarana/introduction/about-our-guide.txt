{title About our guide}

This guide describes the fundamentals of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}, the core text
of the Pāṇinian school of Sanskrit grammar.

At heart, the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is a practical system that serves a practical
need: to decide which Sanskrit expressions are valid and which are not. In this
guide, we focus on {em how} the system works and avoid digressions into theory
and minute details. We discuss all of of the text's major systems, including
nominal and verbal derivation, the root and nominal suffix systems, and
compounding.

Our guide expects a basic familiarity with Sanskrit grammatical concepts. But
interested beginners will still be able to follow along with a bit of extra
work.

overview of Sanskrit grammar, please use our {url[r=guide.index] Sanskrit for
Beginners} guide instead.

{h Origins of the Pāṇinian school}

The {dfn Vedas}, the oldest of all Sanskrit compositions, have been passed down
through a continuous oral tradition that is thousands of years old.

As time passed and cultures changed, six disciplines called the {s-dfn
vedAGga} evolved to protect the Vedas in their structure and function. There is
{s-dfn zikSA}, the study of speech sounds and their correct pronunciation;
{s-dfn chandas}, the study of meter and poetic form; {s-dfn nirukta}, the
study of etymological interpretation; {s-dfn jyotiSa}, the study of
timekeeping and the stars; {s-dfn kalpa}, the study of correct ritual; and
{s-dfn vyAkaraNa}, the most prestigious of the six, which is the study of
grammar and linguistic analysis.

Though there have been many schools of {s vyAkaraNa}, there is only one that is
truly pre-eminent. That is {s-dfn pANinIya-vyAkaraNa}, the tradition of the
grammarian {dfn Pāṇini}. Pāṇini lived sometime around the 5th
century BCE, and we know little about his life beyond that. But what we {em do}
have is the system he developed and perfected. Pāṇini's treatment of Sanskrit
is so thorough and so precise that no older schools of {s vyAkaraNa} survive.
Evidently, they were no longer worth retaining.

The core of the Pāṇinian system is the {dfn {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}} ("the eight
chapters"), a list of around 4000 rules divided into eight chapters. Together,
these rules generate grammatically valid Sanskrit expressions. And if an
expression is {em not} grammatically valid, then it cannot be generated by the
system of rules.

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is so comprehensive that essentially all later Sanskrit
literature is consistent with its model of Sanskrit. Perhaps Pāṇini's greatest
achievement is that he "froze" Sanskrit and preserved the form it has today.


{h The later tradition}

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is the core of the system, but it depends on a number of
secondary texts, including:

{ul
    {li the {cite Dhātupāṭha}, which is a list of all basic verb roots with
    their meanings;}
    {li the {cite Gaṇapāṭha}, which is a "list of lists" of various words and
    stems;}
    {li the {cite Uṇādipāṭha}, which contains rules for ad-hoc derivations}
}

In addition, there are important texts later in the tradition that clarify the
overall system and fix omissions and oversights from the original text. The
most important of these are the {cite Vārttika} by Kātyāyana and the {cite
Mahābhāṣya} by Patañjali. These two texts are so vital that Pāṇini, Kātyāyana,
and Patañjali are together called the {s munitraya} ("the triad of sages")
responsible for the tradition.

This is not to mention the centuries of commentary and exposition that followed
later, most notably in the {cite Kāśikāvr̥tti} and the {cite
Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntakaumudī}.

In this guide, however, we focus squarely on the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} with
occasional reference to the {cite Dhātupāṭha} and the {cite Gaṇapāṭha}.


{h Why study the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}?}

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} has an obvious appeal to anyone who is intellectually
curious. If you are interested in linguistics, mathematics, computer science,
information theory, philosophy of language, Indian intellectual traditions, or
all of the above: welcome! Feel free to skip to the next section below.

There is also an obvious appeal to those who want to preserve traditional
Indian practices and knowledge systems. If this applies to you, we think you
should proceed in the traditional way and find a teacher, perhaps through the
classes from {a[href=https://www.sanskritfromhome.org] Vyoma-Saṃskṛta-Pāṭhaśālā}.

Otherwise, the common-sense reason to study the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is that 
it will improve your Sanskrit. But is that actually true?

It's true if you are an advanced learner who wants to understand subtle points
of usage and become an authority on correct Sanskrit. Then the {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī} will be of tremendous value to you.

But for beginning and intermediate learners, we do not think that studying the
{cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} will meaningfully improve your Sanskrit. Research on second
language acquisition is clear: we acquire proficiency in a language by hearing
or listening to meaningful content. Engaging with meaningful content is much
more important, and much more effective, than studying grammar rules. (See our
{url[r=site.resources] resources page} for tips on where to find such content.)


{h Entering the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}}

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is exceptionally difficult to understand without help.
This is for several reasons:

{ul
    {li It follows the {dfn sutra} style, which is aphoristic, terse, and only
    truly accessible through expert commentaries. (The advantage of the sutra
    style is that its texts are compact and easier to memorize.)}

    {li It uses highly technical Sanskrit that is more like a computer program
    than a piece of natural language. Even someone fluent in Sanskrit will
    struggle to understand it.}

    {li Its core rules are often mutually dependent: to know one, we must
    understand several others.}
}

It is only natural, then, that an entire tradition of Sanskrit commentaries has
arisen to make the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} accessible. Even so, the true beginner
finds these texts complex and overwhelming. And of course, they presume a
thorough knowledge of Sanskrit.

There are also translations and non-Sanskrit commentaries available. But these,
too, are often too complex to be useful to the novice. Likewise, the various
popular resources are often too vague or basic to say anything useful about how
the system really works.


{h Our approach}

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} constantly raises fascinating theoretical questions. But
at its core, it is a practical system that serves a practical need: to decide
which expressions are valid Sanskrit and which are not. Our approach is
likewise a practical one that builds up the Pāṇinian system from scratch.

Each lesson starts with a specific problem that we need to address. Then, the
lesson introduces the specific rules and concepts that the Pāṇinian system uses
to solve the problem. By solving one problem, we often catch sight of another,
which we address in the next lesson. In this way, we work through the system as
a whole.

Our guide is split into different {dfn units}, each of which focuses on a
major component of Sanskrit grammar. Within each unit, we focus on different
functional areas of the text. We cover each area with enough detail to give a
useful sense of what it is like, but not in so much detail that the reader is
lost in minor exceptions.

Here is what the units ahead contain:

{ol
    {li We start with the problem of modeling different sounds and sound rules.
    In the process, we learn about some of the core devices that the {cite
    Aṣṭādhyāyī} uses to stay expressive and concise.}

    {li Once we have a clear high-level view of the system, we look at the
    principles of verb derivation. Starting from an initial set of semantic
    conditions, we apply the rules of the system to create complete words.}

    {li We then do the same for nominal derivation. We also take a
    detour into how the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} handles the semantics of sentences.}

    {li Next, we investigate the root suffixes ({s kRt}) that create various
    verbal nouns and adjectives.}

    {li As follow-up, we investage the nominal suffixes ({s taddhita}) that
    extend and modify nominal stems.}

    {li Finally, we investigate the compound system.}

{h Our hopes for this guide}

If you want to deepen your Sanskrit knowledge, we hope our guide will provide
a smooth and useful entrance into the world of {s vyAkaraNa}. If you are
curious about the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} itself, we hope our guide will reveal the
core of the system and give you a sense of how its ancient creators approached
the world of word and language.

Not everyone can master the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}, but everyone can appreciate its
profound and ingenious design. We hope that our guide will make it easier than
ever to do so.
