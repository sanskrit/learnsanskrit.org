learnsanskrit.org
=================

This is the source code for [learnsanskrit.org](http://learnsanskrit.org),
a website with resources for learning and processing Sanskrit. The site is
built with [Flask](flask.pocoo.org/) and uses too many Python and JavaScript
libraries to comfortably list here.

For information on building learnsanskrit.org locally, see the
[wiki](https://github.com/sanskrit/learnsanskrit.org/wiki).

All contributions are welcome!
