Three consonant combinations are pronounced in an unintuitive way:

- {{ 'jJa'|i }} is pronounced almost like {{ 'gJa'|i }}
- {{ 'hma'|i }} and {{ 'hna'|i }} are pronounced like {{ 'mha'|i }} and {{ 'nha'|i }}.

The history of these special pronunciations is uncertain. But this is how Sanskrit is usually pronounced today.
