If you breathe out and make your breath voiced, you'll hear a sound like "haaa." That "h" is our last consonant:

{{ m.sounds(
    ('ha', 'ha', '(no match)'),
) }}

`ha` is pronounced with the soft palate, at the back of the mouth. It is treated as a **voiced and aspirated** consonant.

!!! note
    `ha` is the same breathy sound that you hear in `gha`, `jha`, `Dha`, `dha`, and `bha`.
