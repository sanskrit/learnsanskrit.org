The stop letters are simple sounds produced in a simple way:

{{ m.sounds(
) }}

But as with many things in life, these letters become more interesting when they become more complex. To start, we can make a stop <dfn>voiced</dfn> or <dfn>unvoiced</dfn>:

{{ m.sounds(
    ('ka', 'ka', '"k" in "skill"'),
    ('ga', 'ga', '"g" in "gill"'),
) }}

But Sanskrit complicates the stop consonants in a second way. Recall that a stop is produced when the flow of air stops then quickly resumes. In `ka`, this flow resumes normally, like water from a tap. But this flow can also resume explosively, like water bursting through a dam:

{{ m.sounds(
    ('kha', 'kha', '"k" in "kill"'),
    ('gha', 'gha', '(no match)'),
) }}

Sounds like `kha` and `gha` are called <dfn>aspirated</dfn> ("breathy"), and sounds like `ka` and `ga` are <dfn>unaspirated</dfn> ("not breathy").

!!! note
    `gha` is both voiced and aspirated.


25 stops and nasals
-------------------

Each of the five points of sound has **four** stops and one nasal. Together, these give us 25 sounds:

{{ m.sounds(
    ('ka', 'ka', '"k" in "skill"'),
    ('kha', 'kha', '"k" in "kill"'),
    ('ga', 'ga', '"g" in "gill"'),
    ('gha', 'gha', '(no match)'),
    ('Ga', 'na_k', '"ng" in "lung"'),

    ('ca', 'ca', '(no match)'),
    ('cha', 'cha', '(no match)'),
    ('ja', 'ja', '(no match)'),
    ('jha', 'jha', '(no match)'),
    ('Ja', 'na_j', '(no match)'),

    ('Ta', 'ta1', '(no match)'),
    ('Tha', 'tha1', '(no match)'),
    ('Da', 'da1', '(no match)'),
    ('Dha', 'dha1', '(no match)'),
    ('Na', 'na1', '(no match)'),

    ('ta', 'ta', '"th" in "thumb"'),
    ('tha', 'tha', '(no match)'),
    ('da', 'da', '"th" in "this"'),
    ('dha', 'dha', '(no match)'),
    ('na', 'na', '"n" in "nose"'),

    ('pa', 'pa', '"p" in "spill"'),
    ('pha', 'pha', '"p" in "pill"'),
    ('ba', 'ba', '"b" in "bill"'),
    ('bha', 'bha', '(no match)'),
    ('ma', 'ma', '"m" in "mill"'),
) }}


This arrangement is over 2800 years old. It stands at the beginning of the Indian linguistic tradition.


`varga`
-------

The Sanskrit word <dfn>`varga`</dfn> lets us create a shorthand for certain groups of consonants:

- {{ 'kavarga'|i('dfn') }} for the five consonants (4 stops + 1 nasal) at the soft palate
- {{ 'cavarga'|i('dfn') }} for the five at the hard palate
- {{ 'Tavarga'|i('dfn') }} for the five that are retroflexed
- {{ 'tavarga'|i('dfn') }} for the five at the teeth
- {{ 'pavarga'|i('dfn') }} for the five at the lips

We can also refer to the semivowels with the term {{ 'yavarga'|i('dfn') }}.


Blending stops with other stops
-------------------------------

Stops blend very easily, whether with nasals:

!!! examples
    - {{ m.x('tat na Asyam', 'That is not a mouth.') }}
    - {{ m.x('rAT naraH', 'The king is a man.') }}

or with most other letters. Stops become **voiced** in front of any voiced sound, including vowels:

!!! examples
    - {{ m.x('tat asat -> tad asat', 'That is false.') }}
    - {{ m.x('vAk eva -> vAg eva', 'speech itself') }}

semivowels:

!!! examples
    - {{ m.x('tat yacchati -> tad yacchati', 'He restrains it.') }}

and other stops:

!!! examples
    - {{ m.x('sa rAT bhavati -> sa rAD bhavati', 'He becomes a king.') }}

but even though they change a little bit, these consonants still use the same point of sound.

As before, stops only blend <em>between</em> words, not inside them. Otherwise, we would become hopelessly confused:

!!! examples
    - {{ m.x('tan mantram', 'That is a mantra.') }}
    - {{ m.x('tan ma[ndra]m', 'That is charming.') }}

Try to blend the words in the phrases below:

!!! examples
    - {{ m.x('na asat AsIt na u sat AsIt tadAnIm') }}
    - {{ m.x('uta amRtatvasya IzAno yat annena atirohati') }}

These are lines from various Vedic hymns:{% filter foot(notes) %}Like most all Vedic Sanskrit, the lines here are open to some interpretation.{% endfilter %}

!!! examples
    -   {{ m.x('nAsad AsIn no sad AsIt tadAnIm', 'Then there was neither nothing nor anything.') }}

        <cite>N훮sad카ya S큰kta</cite>

    -   {{ m.x('utAmRtatvasyezAno yad annenAtirohati', 'And he is the lord of immortality, who grows further by food.') }}

        <cite>Purusha S큰kta</cite>

The first example is from one of the most popular Vedic hymns. The line had all of its blending undone, but we were able to fully restore it.
