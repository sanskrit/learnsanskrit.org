    <h1>Learning Sanskrit</h1>

    <h2>Reference</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/sanskritgrammarf014425mbp">A Sanskrit Grammar for Students</a> by A. A. MacDonnell &mdash; Michael Coulson recommends this grammar in <i>Teach Yourself Sanskrit</i>, and with good reason; it is among the more readable and user-friendly grammars available.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/KALEScan/disp1/index1.php?sfx=png">A Higher Sanskrit Grammar</a> by M. R. Kale &mdash; This is the only Sanskrit grammar in English that copiously refers to Panini's system. You can also <a href="http://archive.org/details/highersanskritgr00kaleuoft">download the book as a PDF</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/sanskritgrammari00whituoft">Sanskrit Grammar</a> by W. D. Whitney &mdash; Michael Coulson describes W. D. Whitney as a <q data-src="Teach Yourself Sanskrit xix">great but startingly arrogant</q> Sanskrit scholar, and his book gives the same impression. Still, this is probably the most complete Sanskrit grammar book available in English.</p>
        <p>A scanned copy of the book is linked above, but you can also <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sanskrit_Grammar">read a plain text version</a> online.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Traditional</h2>
    <p>If your goal is just to read Sanskrit texts, traditional grammar is too complex. But for your curiosity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[book] <a href="http://www.wilbourhall.org/index.html#panini">The Ashtadhayi of Panini</a>. It consists of eight parts:
        <ol>
            <li>Technical terms and rules of interpretation</li>
            <li>Nouns, compounds, and cases</li>
            <li>Attaching suffixes to verb roots</li>
            <li>Attaching suffixes to noun stems (1)</li>
            <li>Attaching suffixes to noun stems (2)</li>
            <li>Accent and phonetic changes (1)</li>
            <li>Accent and phonetic changes (2)</li>
            <li>Sentences</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is the foundation of Sanskrit grammar. The translation by Srisa Chandra Vasu has all of the rules in Sanskrit, a Sanskrit commentary, his English translation, and his English commentary.</p>

    <h2>Vedic</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>[book] <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/vedicgrammarfor00macduoft">A Vedic Grammar for Students</a> &mdash; A. A. MacDonnell.</li>
        <li>[book] <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924023050325">Vedic Grammar</a> &mdash; A. A. MacDonnell.
    </ul>

    <h2>Conversational</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://acharya.iitm.ac.in/sanskrit/tutor.php">Learn Sanskrit through self-study</a> &mdash; For years, this has been the most popular and well-loved Sanskrit resource on the Internet.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.samskritabharati.org/">Samskrita Bharati</a> &mdash; By teaching Sanskrit in a conversational setting. Samskrita Bharati hopes to illustrate that Sanskrit is a viable conversational language that can bring <q>cultural renaissance,</q> <q>social harmony,</q> and <q>national integration,</q> presumably to the Indian community. The organization is best known for its classes and workshops.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supplementary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.ubcsanskrit.ca">UBC Sanskrit</a> &mdash; Parts of the site are incomplete, but what it does offer is gracefully taught. It is refreshing to see the cleanliness and care with which the examples are constructed. Sound included.</p></li>
