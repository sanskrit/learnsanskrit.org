<p>Generally, any sound that is not a vowel is called a <dfn>consonant</dfn>. Sanskrit has 33 consonants in all: the 25 stops and nasals, the 4 semivowels, and the 4 sounds that we will study in this lesson.</p>


<h2>The consonants</h2>
<p>Like all Sanskrit consonants, these four use the following "points of sound":</p>

{% include 'guide/include/sound-points.html' %}

<p>As you pronounce these letters, be mindful of these five points.</p>

<h3>"s" sounds</h3>
<p>Once more, picture the flow of air that makes the vowel {{ 'a'|i }}. It starts in the lungs, moves through the throat, and flows cleanly through the mouth, like a river flowing straight.</p>

<p>Normally, the air flows simply and straight. But when this air flow becomes <em>turbulent</em>, we get a "hissing" sound, like the "s" in "snake" or the "sh" in "shore." For convenience, let us call these sounds <dfn>"s" sounds</dfn>.</p>

<p>English has two "s" sounds: the "s" in "snake" and the "sh" in "shore." But Sanskrit has three:</p>

<ul class="grid-3 letters">
    {{ sound('za', '(no match)', 'sha') }}
    {{ sound('Sa', '(no match)', 'shha') }}
    {{ sound('sa', '"s" in "snake"') }}
</ul>

<p>{{ 'za'|i }} uses the hard palate. {{ 'Sa'|i }} is retroflexed. {{ 'sa'|i }} is just like the English "s".</p>

<h3>{{ 'ha'|i }}</h3>

<p>If you breathe out and make your breath voiced, you'll hear a sound like "haaa." That "h" is our last consonant:</p>

<ul class="letters">
    {{ sound('ha', '(no match)') }}
</ul>

<p>{{ 'ha'|i }} is the same breathy sound that you hear in {{ 'gha'|i }}, {{ 'jha'|i }}, {{ 'Dha'|i }}, {{ 'dha'|i }}, and {{ 'bha'|i }}. {{ 'ha'|i }} is pronounced with the soft palate, at the back of the mouth.</p>

<p>Together, the four consonants above are called <dfn>{{ 'zavarga'|i }}</dfn>.</p>

<h3>Special combinations</h3>
<p>Three consonant combinations are pronounced in a distinct way. {{ 'jJa'|i }} is pronounced more like {{ 'gJa'|i }}. {{ 'hma'|i }} and {{ 'hna'|i }} are pronounced like {{ 'mha'|i }} and {{ 'nha'|i }}. The history of these special pronunciations is uncertain. But this is how Sanskrit is usually pronounced today.</p>

<h2>Blending {{ 't'|i }}</h2>

<aside class="note"><p>The {{ 'a'|i }} at the end of a consonant makes the consonant easy to pronounce. But this {{ 'a'|i }} can also be confusing sometimes. So let us create a <em>new convention</em>. From now on, this  guide will not add {{ 'a'|i }} to the end of consonants.</p></aside>

<p>Of all consonants, {{ 't'|i }} blends the most. Just as water spreads to fill its container, {{ 't'|i }} changes to blend with the letter after it.</p>

<p>Like other stops, {{ 't'|i }} can become nasal:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('tat na Asyam -> tan nAsyam', 'That is not a mouth.') }}
    {{ iex('tat mantram -> tan mantram', 'That is a mantra.') }}
</ul>

<p>and voiced:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('tat asat -> tad asat', 'That is false.') }}
</ul>

<p>We have seen these changes already. But {{ 't'|i }} can change in other ways, too. It can become {{ 'l'|i }}:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('tat labhate -> tal labhate', 'He obtains that.') }}
</ul>

<p>and it can also change its point of sound. If the next sound is a stop that <strong>uses the tongue</strong>, then it changes:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('tat cApam -> tac cApam', 'That is a bow.') }}
    {{ iex('tat TIkAsu -> taT TIkAsu', 'That is in the commentaries.') }}
    {{ iex('tat tanoti', 'He spreads that.') }}
</ul>

<p>even if those sounds are voiced:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('tat jAyate -> taj jAyate', 'That is born.') }}
    {{ iex('tat Damarau -> taD Damarau', 'That is in the drum.') }}
    {{ iex('tat dahati -> tad dahati', 'That burns.') }}
</ul>

<p>For other stops ({{ 'kavarga'|i }} and {{ 'pavarga'|i }}), the point of sound does not change:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('tat kaThoram', 'That is hard.') }}
    {{ iex('tat gurum -> tad gurum', 'That is heavy.') }}
    {{ iex('tat phalam', 'That is a fruit.') }}
    {{ iex('tat bIjam -> tad bIjam', 'That is a seed.') }}
</ul>

<h3>In the wild</h3>

<p>Try to blend the words in the phrase below:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('yat bhUtaM yat ca bhavyam') }}
</ul>

<p>This phrase is from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha_sukta"><cite>Puruṣa Sūkta</cite></a>, one of the most popular Vedic hymns:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ iex('yad bhUtaM yac ca bhavyam', '(He is all of this) which has been and which is yet to be.', cite='<cite>Puruṣa Sūkta</cite>') }}
</ul>

<p>Our Sanskrit alphabet is almost complete. Only two sounds remain.</p>
