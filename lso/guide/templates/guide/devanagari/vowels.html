<p>Although vowel marks are very common in Sanskrit, vowel letters are very rare. They only appear in a few circumstances, which we won't detail here.</p>

<h2>The letters</h2>
<ul class="grid-4 letters">
    {{ row('a A i I') }}
    {{ row('u U R RR') }}
    {{ row('e ai o au') }}
</ul>

<p>The letters below are so rare that they are listed separately. {{ 'lR'|d }}  appears occasionally in some grammatical texts, and {{ 'lRR'|d }}  is even less frequent.</p>

<ul class="grid-2 letters">
    {{ row('lR lRR') }}
</ul>

<h2>Common vowels</h2>
<p>Usually, students try to memorize the vowels in order. This is slow and unrewarding. Some vowels are so rare that they almost never appear in Sanskrit. By focusing on common vowels first, you can save yourself quite a bit of wasted effort:</p>
