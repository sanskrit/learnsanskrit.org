<p>Learning Sanskrit is like building a massive house. Our materials are the Sanskrit sounds, which we combine and blend to create stems, endings, words, and sentences. Our techniques are the rules of grammar, which have stayed simple so far. And our approach is still a practical one: build a basic shelter before expanding further.</p>

<p>Now we have built our foundation, and there are many ways to expand. But let's return to the humble verb, where we started our journey into Sanskrit:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('khAdanti', 'They eat.') }}
</ul>

<p>The verb is {{ 'khAdanti'|i }} and the stem is {{ 'khAda'|i }}. But there is more to see than just {{ 'khAda'|i }}:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('khAdanti', 'They eat.') }}
    {{ ex('naraH <mark>khAdiSyati</mark>', 'The man <mark>will eat</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naraH <mark>khAdyate</mark>', 'The man <mark>is eaten</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('pazyAmi <mark>khAdakam</mark>', 'I see <mark>the eater</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naraH <mark>khAditaH</mark>', 'The man <mark>has been eaten</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naraH <mark>khAditvA</mark> gacchati', 'The man goes <mark>after eating</mark>.') }}
</ul>

<p>In all of these words we see something more subtle than the verb stem. It is a basic core that seems to endure. This is the <dfn>root</dfn>:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('khAd -> khAda -> khAdati', 'He eats.') }}
</ul>

<h2>Creating roots</h2>
<p>Just as a single tree trunk produces many branches and flowers, a single root produces many stems and words. But just as the roots of the tree remain hidden from view, so too is it difficult to tell what a root really is. In the forms above, the root is obviously {{ 'khAd'|i }}. But consider the forms below:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('jayanti', 'They conquer.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>jeSyati</mark>', 'The man <mark>will conquer</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>jIyate</mark>', 'The man <mark>is conquered</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('pazyAmi <mark>jayakam</mark>', 'I see <mark>the victor</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>jitaH</mark>', 'The man <mark>has been conquered</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>jitvA</mark> gacchati', 'The man goes <mark>after conquering</mark>.') }}
</ul>

<p>It is easy to think of a few possible roots. But consider the difficulties involved:</p>

<ol>
    <li>We must choose a single root that can produce {{ 'jay'|i }}, {{ 'je'|i }}, {{ 'jI'|i }}, and {{ 'ji'|i }}.</li>
    <li>We should make rules to explain how our root transforms into {{ 'jay'|i }}, {{ 'je'|i }}, {{ 'jI'|i }}, and {{ 'ji'|i }}.</li>
    <li>And these rules must be as consistent as possible across all roots and all of the stems that those roots produce.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is an enormous task. But fortunately, the grammarian Panini has done the work for us. Panini defined a full list of verb roots, which can let us know how Panini chose roots. And many of the rules of the Ashtadhyayi are concerned with transforming these roots into the words we really see.</p>

<p>This is one of Panini's basic guideline:</p>

<p class="rule">Roots should use simple vowels. We can then form stems by <em>strengthening</em> the vowel.</p>

<p>Here, we <dfn>strengthen</dfn> a vowel by <a href="{{ lesson_url('sounds', 'compound-vowels') }}">adding an {{ 'a'|i }} vowel to the front of it</a>.</p>

<p>With this guideline in mind, we can find a root for {{ 'jayati'|i }}:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('<mark>ji</mark> -> jayati', 'He conquers.') }}
</ul>

<p>Now consider the words below:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('nayanti', 'They lead.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>neSyati</mark>', 'The man <mark>will lead</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>nIyate</mark>', 'The man <mark>is led</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('pazyAmi <mark>nAyakam</mark>', 'I see <mark>the leader</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>nItaH</mark>', 'The man <mark>has been led</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>nItvA</mark> gacchati', 'The man goes <mark>after leading</mark>.') }}
</ul>

<p>Here is another of Panini's basic guideline:</p>

<p class="rule">Roots should contain as much useful information as possible.</p>

<p>With this guideline in mind, we can find a root for {{ 'nayati'|i }}:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('<mark>nI</mark> -> nayati', 'He leads.') }}
</ul>

<p>Now consider the words below:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('gacchanti', 'They go.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>gamiSyati</mark>', 'The man <mark>will go</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>gamyate</mark>', 'The man <mark>is gone to</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('pazyAmi <mark>gamakam</mark>', 'I see <mark>the indicator</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>gataH</mark>', 'The man <mark>has been gone to</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>gatvA</mark> gacchati', 'The man goes <mark>after going</mark>.') }}
</ul>

<p>Here is one final guideline:</p>

<p class="rule">When there's no clear or simple pattern, roots should be something common.</p>

<p>With this guideline in mind, we can find a root for {{ 'gacchati'|i }}:</p>


<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('<mark>gam</mark> -> gacchati', 'He goes.') }}
</ul>

<h2>Irregular roots</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the words involved are too difficult to explain:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('tiSThanti', 'They stand.') }}
    {{ ex('naraH <mark>sthAsyati</mark>', 'The man <mark>will stand</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naraH <mark>sthIyate</mark>', 'The man <mark>is stationed</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('pazyAmi <mark>sthAnam</mark>', 'I see <mark>the place</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naraH <mark>sthitaH</mark>', 'The man <mark>is standing</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>sthitvA</mark> gacchati', 'The man goes <mark>after standing</mark>.') }}
</ul>

<p>Forms like these exist because Sanskrit is an old language and we do not fully understand its early history. Panini coped with these forms by adding extra rules and exceptions. He defined the root like this:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('<mark>sthA</mark> -> tiSThati', 'stand -> He stands.') }}
</ul>

<p>But it would take too long to explain why.</p>

<p>Some changes can also seem totally bizarre:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('pazyanti', 'They see.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>drakSyati</mark>', 'The man <mark>will see</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>dRzyate</mark>', 'The man <mark>is seen</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('pazyAmi <mark>darzakam</mark>', 'I see <mark>the one who sees</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>dRSTaH</mark>', 'The man <mark>has been seen</mark>.') }}
    {{ ex('naro <mark>dRSTvA</mark> gacchati', 'The man goes <mark>after seeing</mark>.') }}
</ul>

<p>The roots here are {{ 'paz'|i }} and {{ 'dRz'|i }}. This is a strange case where two roots have started to complement each other. It's like two trees fusing into one. The modern convention is to refer to these two with just {{ 'dRz'|i }}:</p>

<ul class="examples">
    {{ ex('<mark>dRz</mark> -> pazyati', 'see -> He sees.') }}
</ul>

<p>Panini's system has some flaws, and it is not the only system available. But regardless of its imperfections, it has been <em>extremely</em> successful for thousands of years. All Sanskrit texts use it, and this guide will do the same.</p>
